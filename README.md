I hope that you can find what you are searching for. I tried to approach the field of algorithms for myself while writing down the important stuff for everyone to access. My first approach is to implement the algorithms in Python 3. Doing so, I tried to document my code well while inmplementing it in a "pythonic" way. So that it is optimized for Python.
