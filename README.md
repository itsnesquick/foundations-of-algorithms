# Welcome to Foundations of Algorithms
I hope that you can find what you are searching for. I tried to approach the field of algorithms for myself while writing down the important stuff for everyone to access. My first approach is to implement the algorithms in Python 3. Doing so, I tried to document my code well while implementing it in a "pythonic" way, such that it is optimized for Python.

## Algorithms
Algorithms are well-defined computational procedures that take a certain input and produce an output. Doing so, a good algorithm:
*1. Halts (terminates),
*2. Generates the same output when given the same input instances,
*3. Can be broken down to a specific set of steps (computational procedures to be followed).

Therefore you can describe an algorithm as a sequence of computational steps with an input/output relation.
An algorithm is said to be correct if, for every input instance, it terminates with the correct output.
As computing time and space in memory is a limited ressource you need to use algorithms wisely in order to keep efficiency in time and space.
